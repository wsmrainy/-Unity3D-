#A-eating-fish-game-develop-based-on-Unity3D
With the continuous development of computer graphics software and hardware and the increasing popularity of personal computers, computer games have become an important entertainment method in people's lives, among which the eating-fish game is a popular entertainment game. However, currently the eating-fish games on the market are all 2D games, the game experience is poor, and the game immersion needs to be optimized. To enhance the experience and immersion of the fish-eating game, a 3D version of the eating-fish game based on the Unity3D game engine was researched and designed. Using the Unity3D game engine development platform, we focused on constructing lifelike game scenes including sky environment, underwater world, underwater animal and plant ecology. Combined with Unity3D game engine and C # programming technology, the research and implementation of fish-grouping algorithm to simulate the swimming of fish in real nature. In addition, to enhance the interactive experience, we designed realistic sound effects and fish counting function. After the game is developed, players can cruise in the grotesque underwater world, and use the mouse and keyboard to control the big fish to eat the little fish, which greatly  enhances the game experience and immersion.
